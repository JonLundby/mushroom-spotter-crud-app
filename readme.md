## Mushroom spotter app

_A CRUD app for spotting mushrooms in nature._

_Known issues to be fixed, ideas and to-do stuff:_<br>
_- when cancelling update if seasonStart/End is blank they will be updated to "" empty string???_<br>
_- connection between post spotter property and spotter object. Fx when detail view shows spotter then the spotter property number should refer to spotter object id_<br>
_- make sure that the map url starts with https://www.google.com/maps_<br>
_- make small animations to make the page more lively_<br>
